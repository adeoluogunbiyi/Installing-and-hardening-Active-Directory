# Installing-and-hardening-Active-Directory
## Overview
This project provides a complete, end‑to‑end walkthrough for installing, configuring, and hardening an Active Directory (AD) environment.
It demonstrates how to build a secure Windows Server domain from scratch, implement core identity services, and apply industry‑standard security controls to reduce attack surface and strengthen domain resilience.
The documentation covers key stages such as domain deployment, Group Policy configuration, privilege management, auditing, and baseline hardening techniques aligned with real‑world enterprise practices.
This project serves as both a learning resource and a practical reference for anyone looking to understand AD architecture, improve security posture, or showcase hands‑on cybersecurity and systems administration skills.
